# 2015_GECCO_Bongard
Contains all of the material for replicating the paper entitled 'Evolving robot morphology facilitates the evolution of neural modularity and evolvability'

The paper itself is available here: http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/papers/2015_GECCO_Bongard.pdf

This readme file will help you to replicate the results from the paper. This is done in a gradual fashion: each step enables you to replicate
one of the figures or tables in the paper.

Step 1: Replicate Figure 1.

- Click on Fig1.pdf in this directory.

Step 2: Replicate Figure 2.

- This figure shows an evolved robot from experiment set 3 in Table 1. This robot was produced by allowing both the neural network and
  morphology of the robot to evolve. A bi-objective fitness function is used that only selects for age and grasping (the AFPO optimization
  method was used here).
